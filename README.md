**Multi taxi is here. Share value with other taxi users.**

The project is a new generation economic taxi experience project that will be used by passengers in very close locations when they go to the same central key points in the city. We implemented innovative location-based GPS algorithms. These new location-based GPS  algorithms we use will provide huge fuel savings in shared transportation systems. It is an environmentally friendly project that consumes less fuel, provides sustainability and at the same time provides socialization with a very high marginal contribution. In this project, a location has been calculated in such a way as to solve the problems in the existing GPS algorithms and have the least distance to travel.
